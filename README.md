# ThreadStack Project

ThreadStack is a dynamic web application designed for creating and managing threaded discussions. This project allows users to participate in discussions by creating threads, posting responses, and viewing current threads on various topics. It utilizes React for the frontend, showcasing components for dashboard navigation, category management, user profiles, and detailed thread interactions.

## Features

- **Dashboard Overview**: A central place for users to navigate through the application, access different categories, view their profile, and see recent threads.
- **Category Management**: Users can view different discussion categories, making it easier to navigate through topics of interest.
- **User Profile Management**: Allows users to view and edit their profile information, including username, avatar, email, and company affiliation.
- **Thread Interaction**: Users can create new threads, post responses to existing threads, and like posts. This interaction is facilitated through a dynamic component that fetches thread data and updates in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with a focus on user experience, ensuring that the application is accessible across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js is used for building the user interface, with React Router for managing navigation between different components.
- **State Management**: Uses React's Context API for global state management, allowing for efficient propagation of user data throughout the application without prop drilling.
- **Backend Integration**: Demonstrates fetching data from a backend server (mock server in this case) to populate thread and post information.
- **Styling**: Utilizes CSS and Bootstrap for styling, ensuring a clean and modern user interface.
